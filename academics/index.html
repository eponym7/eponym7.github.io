<p><strong>Dissertation Research</strong>: How far can we tolerate or encourage
differences between scientific representations? When do differences
become conflicts which researchers need to resolve? Some scientific
pluralists walk a tightrope, trying to allow as many differences to
coexist as possible without tarnishing science&rsquo;s objectivity. But these
goals work at crosspurposes; allowing differences to coexist undermines
the friction between alternatives in scientific debate, while objecivity
requires such friction to support research standards. The evolutionary
synthesis (c. 1920-1950) illustrates this well: heated debate between
genetics and evolutionary science led both to a new consensus and to
many new avenues of debate. Because of this inescapable tension, there
is a tendency for pluralists to be relativists.</p>

<h3 id="approach-to-philosophy">Approach to Philosophy</h3>
<p>Philosophical questions can be inscrutable, like a sheer, smooth cliff
face. I like to have a practical or empirical handhold, some body of
concrete knowledge to get me started. Often this means history or the
sciences. This rules out reasoning from first principles; any general
principles we get will come late.</p>
<p>This is in keeping with philosophical pragmatism, and I owe a lot to one
of them in particular, C. S. Peirce. He once wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy ought to imitate the successful sciences in its methods, so
far as &hellip; to trust rather to the multitude and variety of its
arguments than to the conclusiveness of any one. Its reasoning should
not form a chain which is no stronger than its weakest link, but a
cable whose fibers may be ever so slender, provided they are
sufficiently numerous and intimately connected.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="approach-to-teaching">Approach to Teaching</h3>
<p>Philosophy is about quiet reflection, which is necessarily leisurely,
but every philosophical question has a practical edge to it somewhere.
In daily life, everyone gets asked why they believe or like something,
has to decide what to do and who to trust, or confronts problems they
have to think through carefully. I try to structure my lectures,
seminars, or tutorials with this in mind. It informs the kinds of
questions I ask students and the analysis I offer them.</p>
<p>Most of my instruction time is spent on detailed examples. I model the
sort of thinking which I hope the students will learn to do. In a course
heavy on readings, I might do close analyses of a smaller section of
text rather than broadly summarise the whole. In a course heavy on
problem sets (like logic or critical thinking), I might give multiple
correct answers to one question, explaining the thinking and process
behind each answer and the significance of any differences.</p>
