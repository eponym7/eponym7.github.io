<strong>Dissertation Research</strong>: How far can we tolerate or encourage differences between scientific representations? When do differences become conflicts that researchers need to resolve? Some scientific pluralists walk a tightrope, downplaying as much conflict as they can while insisting on objective standards for truth and justification. But these goals work at crosspurposes; the former undermines the friction between alternatives in scientific debate, while the latter requires such friction to uphold objective standards. To illustrate this, I draw on the evolutionary synthesis (c. 1920-1950), where heated debate between genetics and evolutionary science led both to a new consensus and to many new avenues of debate.</p>

<h3 id="approach-to-philosophy">Approach to Philosophy</h3>
<p>A philosophical question can be inscrutable, like a sheer cliff face without a tangible way to grip and climb it. I like to have some sort of practical or empirical handhold to get me started, a concrete body of knowledge to draw from. Often this means history or the sciences. So, if I reason from first principles at all, it happens only very late in my understanding, after I&rsquo;ve made a map of the viable paths.</p>
<p>This is in keeping with how the pragmatists worked. And I owe a lot to one of them in particular, C. S. Peirce. His writings are peppered with wisdom, like this passage, which I take to heart whenever I think seriously about something:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Philosophy ought to imitate the successful sciences in its methods, so far as &hellip; to trust rather to the multitude and variety of its arguments than to the conclusiveness of any one. Its reasoning should not form a chain which is no stronger than its weakest link, but a cable whose fibers may be ever so slender, provided they are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="approach-to-teaching">Approach to Teaching</h4>
<p>Philosophy is about quiet reflection, but it&rsquo;s hardly what you would call &ldquo;down to Earth.&rdquo; Nonetheless, every philosophical question has a practical edge to it somewhere. Philosophical questions are continuous with questions people ask in their everyday lives. Everyone gets asked why they believe or like something, has to decide what to do and who to trust, confronts problems they have to think through carefully. This is rarely the explicit point of my lessons and lectures, but it&rsquo;s what informs many of my decisions. I want a reflective student, who studies and listens, to be able to uncover why someone thought to ask such rarefied questions in the first place, and why it&rsquo;s worth studying now. Being able to see what motivated a dense and obtuse argument does wonders to their ability to organise their own thinking.</p>
<p>Most of my instruction time is spent on detailed examples (something that music and math instilled in me). I model the sort of thinking which I hope the students will do. In a course heavy on readings, I might do close analyses of a smaller section of text rather than broadly summarise the whole. In a course heavy on problem sets (like logic or critical thinking), I might give multiple correct answers to one question, explaining the thinking and process behind each answer and the significance of any differences.</p>
