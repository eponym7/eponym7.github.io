      <description>These are some stray thoughts on the relationship between science and art. If I had enough time, they would form the kernel of a larger essay. I still wrote them anyway, because at least then I might end up picking the thread up again later! They are in decent enough shape as is that I don&amp;rsquo;t mind sharing them here.&#xA;1. It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think that science and art have little to do with each other.</description>

      <description>You can see my CV here.&#xA;And you can contact me at rosss23@mcmaster.ca&#xA;Doctoral Candidate I am a doctoral candidate in philosophy at McMaster University under the supervision of Dr. Alex Klein.&#xA;Dissertation Research: How far can we tolerate or encourage differences between scientific representations? When do differences become conflicts that researchers need to resolve? Some scientific pluralists walk a tightrope, downplaying as much conflict as they can while insisting on objective standards for truth and justification.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Canadian philosophy student nearing the end of my PhD. I&amp;rsquo;m also a classical musician who plays the piano.&#xA;This website is part calling card, part oasis for serious leisure (mainly reading and writing).&#xA;What will you write about? There will be two streams: philosophy, and an eclectic hodgepodge of my other interests.&#xA;The philosophy stream will record thoughts which aren&amp;rsquo;t quite publishable but I still find worth sharing. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in questions about inquiry, logic and history, digested with the help of the philosophy of science and pragmatism.</description>
