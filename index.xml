      <description>Today I heard that Alfred Brendel passed away. His recordings of Schubert, Beethoven and Mozart are some of my favourites, but he was also a keen writer and critic. His essays are just as worth reading as his recordings are worth listening. So in remembrance, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a bit of the opening to &amp;ldquo;Schubert&amp;rsquo;s Last Sonatas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Schubert&amp;rsquo;s death deprived us of a wealth of possible masterpieces, though hardly, as Franz Grillparzer&amp;rsquo;s epitaph suggests, of even fairer accomplishment.</description>

      <description>These are some stray thoughts on the relationship between science and art. If I had enough time, they would form the kernel of a larger essay. I still wrote them anyway, because at least then I might end up picking the thread up again later! They are in decent enough shape as is that I don&amp;rsquo;t mind sharing them here.&#xA;1. It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think that science and art have little to do with each other.</description>

      <description>You can see my CV here.&#xA;And you can contact me at rosss23@mcmaster.ca&#xA;Doctoral Candidate I am a doctoral candidate in philosophy at McMaster University under the supervision of Dr. Alex Klein.&#xA;Dissertation Research: How far can we tolerate or encourage differences between scientific representations? When do differences become conflicts which researchers need to resolve? Some scientific pluralists walk a tightrope, trying to allow as many differences to coexist as possible without tarnishing science&amp;rsquo;s objectivity.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Canadian philosophy student nearing the end of my PhD, and a classical musician (I play the piano).&#xA;What is this website for? It&amp;rsquo;s partly an alternative to having social media profiles. But I also want to write here. As a friend of mine put it:&#xA;This is gonna sound corny and hippie as all hell but I think thereâ€™s something to say for a travelogue of the mind, dude.</description>
