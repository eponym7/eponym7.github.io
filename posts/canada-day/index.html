    <p>To mark Canada Day, I thought I&rsquo;d share a poem by Don McKay, a highly underrated Canadian poet. This is &ldquo;Song for the Song of the Canada Geese,&rdquo; from his 2012 collection <em>Paradoxides</em>. He has a longrunning series of poems about birds across several of his books, all with the title &ldquo;Song for the Song of &hellip;,&rdquo; and they tend to be some of his best (in my humble opinion, anyway).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Something of winter, something of winter<br>
again, something of that famous mortal reed<br>
making an oboe of the throat.<br>
As though the soul &ndash; not<br>
so much in pain as under pressure &ndash;<br>
yelped. Angst,<br>
angst, bite-sized bits of loneliness sent<br>
back to the earthless skies<br>
they fell from, giving grief<br>
its rightful place among the elements.<br>
So what<br>
if they waddle, shit<br>
goosehit on the grass all summer then neglect<br>
to migrate? Were the geese to quit<br>
their existential yammer, talk<br>
would also cease, each would-be dialogue collapse<br>
into its own hole. Where there was ivy,<br>
ice. Ice<br>
where there was moss.<br>
All praise to the geese<br>
in their goosiness, to the ragged arrow that is<br>
and isn&rsquo;t eros.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>McKay&rsquo;s sense of humour always shines in his writing, whether it&rsquo;s goofy (like this poem) or dry. And while he invites us to laugh with him, part of his purpose is to lower our guard. He wants us to attend to things, to be curious and receptive to animals and nature, since without &ldquo;their existential yammer, talk / would also cease.&rdquo;</p>
