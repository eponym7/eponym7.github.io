      <description>&lt;p&gt;To mark Canada Day, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a poem by Don McKay, a highly underrated Canadian poet. This is &amp;ldquo;Song for the Song of the Canada Geese,&amp;rdquo; from his 2012 collection &lt;em&gt;Paradoxides&lt;/em&gt;. He has a longrunning series of poems about birds across several of his books, all with the title &amp;ldquo;Song for the Song of &amp;hellip;,&amp;rdquo; and they tend to be some of his best (in my humble opinion, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
