      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I heard that Alfred Brendel passed away. His recordings of Schubert, Beethoven and Mozart are some of my favourites, but he was also a keen writer and critic. His essays are just as worth reading as his recordings are worth listening. So in remembrance, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a bit of the opening to &amp;ldquo;Schubert&amp;rsquo;s Last Sonatas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Schubert&amp;rsquo;s death deprived us of a wealth of possible masterpieces, though hardly, as Franz Grillparzer&amp;rsquo;s epitaph suggests, of even fairer accomplishment. The last three sonatas should not be taken as a final message. As far as we know, they were composed in the brief period between May and September 1828. The fair copy was made just a few weeks before Schubert died of typhoid, his constitution already weakened by syphilis and by a burst of productivity frantic even by his standards. Since the death of his mother, he may have had to come to terms with a growing awareness of his mortality. Yet, when he completed his last sonatas (and most probably the C major Quintet) in the autumn of 1828, it seems to me that he had no intimation of imminent death.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
