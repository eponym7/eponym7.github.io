      <description>Today I heard that Alfred Brendel passed away. His recordings of Schubert, Beethoven and Mozart are some of my favourites, but he was also a keen writer and critic. His essays are just as worth reading as his recordings are worth listening. So in remembrance, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share a bit of the opening to &amp;ldquo;Schubert&amp;rsquo;s Last Sonatas.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Schubert&amp;rsquo;s death deprived us of a wealth of possible masterpieces, though hardly, as Franz Grillparzer&amp;rsquo;s epitaph suggests, of even fairer accomplishment.</description>
