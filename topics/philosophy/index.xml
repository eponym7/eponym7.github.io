      <description>These are some stray thoughts on the relationship between science and art. If I had enough time, they would form the kernel of a larger essay. I still wrote them anyway, because at least then I might end up picking the thread up again later! They are in decent enough shape as is that I don&amp;rsquo;t mind sharing them here.&#xA;1. It&amp;rsquo;s tempting to think that science and art have little to do with each other.</description>
